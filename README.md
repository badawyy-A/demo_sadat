# Fitness Assessment and Sport Recommendation System

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive **Fitness Assessment and Sport Recommendation System** designed to evaluate candidates' fitness levels (ages 5-18) and suggest suitable sports based on their performance.  It leverages **computer vision** for automated video analysis of fitness tests and an **AI-powered recommendation engine** (using Google's Gemini API) to provide personalized sport suggestions. The system is built with a modular backend (Python) and an interactive frontend (Streamlit and React.js).

## ðŸš€ Features

*   **Automated Fitness Assessment:**  Analyzes video recordings of standardized fitness tests using YOLOv8 pose estimation.
*   **Age-Specific Tests:** Supports different tests for two age groups:
    *   **Ages 5-8:** Plate Tapping (coordination) and Flamingo Balance Test.
    *   **Ages 9-18:** Push-ups, Curl-ups, 600m Run/Walk, and 50m Dash.
*   **AI-Powered Recommendations:**  Uses Google's Gemini API to generate personalized sport recommendations based on the assessed fitness attributes and a knowledge base of sport requirements.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:**  A Streamlit and React.js web application provides an intuitive interface for:
    *   Entering candidate details (age, gender, weight, height).
    *   Uploading video recordings of fitness tests.
    *   Viewing calculated scores and performance levels.
    *   Receiving top 3 sport recommendations.
*   **BMI Calculation:** Automatically calculates and displays the candidate's Body Mass Index (BMI).
*   **Modular Design:**  Well-structured code with separate modules for computer vision, scoring, recommendations, and the Streamlit UI, making it easy to maintain and extend.
*   **JSON Output:**  Saves intermediate results (CV analysis and scores) to JSON files for further analysis or integration with other systems.

## ðŸ“Š Usage (Workflow)

1.  **Candidate Information:** The user (e.g., a coach) enters the candidate's age, gender, weight, and height.
2.  **Video Upload:** Based on the candidate's age, the user is prompted to upload the appropriate video recordings of the required fitness tests.
3.  **Automated Analysis:** The system processes the uploaded videos using YOLOv8 pose estimation to extract relevant performance metrics (e.g., repetitions, time, balance errors).
4.  **Scoring:** The extracted metrics are compared against age- and gender-specific benchmarks (currently using *placeholder* data â€“ **see Important Notes below**) to determine performance levels and scores.
5.  **Recommendation Generation:**  The calculated scores, along with the candidate's information, are sent to the Gemini API, which provides a ranked list of the top 3 recommended sports.
6.  **Results Display:** The Streamlit app displays the calculated BMI, individual test scores, performance levels, and the top 3 recommended sports.
